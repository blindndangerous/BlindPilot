# BlindPilot

A vibe-coded, screen-reader-friendly desktop front end for AI coding agents on Windows and macOS, built so Claude Code, Codex, FreeBuff, and opencode can be driven without reading a terminal.

BlindPilot is based on the original **[Claude Code Reader](https://github.com/doubletaponair/claude-code-reader)** by [doubletaponair](https://github.com/doubletaponair). It keeps that project's accessibility-first design and adds a pluggable multi-backend system. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Features

- Native wxPython controls throughout, so NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver read the app rather than interpreting a terminal.
- Runs Claude Code, Codex, FreeBuff, and opencode, switchable from the File menu and remembered between launches.
- Segments every answer into navigable rows: one per heading, paragraph, list item, quote, code block, thought, tool action, and tool result.
- Reads answers aloud as they arrive, or stays quiet until the whole answer is ready.
- Reopens past conversations from any backend, titled by the message that started them, and carries on where they left off.
- Compacts a long conversation in place so the backend has room to keep going.
- Runs several project sessions at once, each with its own conversation, folder, model, and permission mode.
- Steers a task while it is still running, or stops it outright and keeps what it produced.
- Attaches files and pasted clipboard images as explicit prompt paths.
- Searches responses, jumps between them, and copies a code block, a whole response, or the whole conversation.
- Picks the model and reasoning effort from whatever the installed CLI actually reports.
- Marks sent, working, and received with earcons, so a long run is audible without being spoken.
- Installs, updates, adds to PATH, and signs into any of the four backends from an accessible wizard.
- Updates itself from GitHub Releases after verifying the published SHA-256.

## Backends

| Backend | Integration | Sessions | Model control | Permission modes | Compaction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Streaming JSON CLI | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Codex | Official app-server protocol | Yes | Yes, including reasoning effort | Yes | Yes |
| FreeBuff | Pseudo-terminal adapter | Yes | Yes; DeepSeek V4 Pro by default | Managed by FreeBuff | No |
| opencode | Its own headless HTTP server | Yes | Yes, including per-model reasoning variants | Yes | Yes |

FreeBuff ships no JSON or headless API, so BlindPilot runs its terminal interface in a hidden pseudo-terminal, reads the answer off its screen a finished sentence at a time, and captures its chat id so the conversation can be resumed. Terminal redraws and advertisements are filtered out before anything is spoken. Its permission picker and Compact Conversation are disabled because the FreeBuff CLI has no equivalent.

opencode is driven through the same headless server its own terminal interface uses. BlindPilot starts one, shared by every tab, on the loopback interface behind a password generated for the run, and reads the turn off its event stream. That is what gives opencode every feature the other backends have — streaming answers, steering a running turn, stopping one, permission modes, compaction, resuming a past conversation — plus `/connect` and a model picker covering every provider it can reach. Past conversations come out of opencode's own SQLite database, read-only.

## Download and install

Grab the latest build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/serrebidev/BlindPilot/releases).
For a version-by-version history, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Windows installer (recommended)**

1. Download `BlindPilot-Setup-x64.exe`.
2. Run it. It installs per user with no administrator prompt, adds a Start Menu entry, and closes a running copy before replacing it.

**Windows portable**

1. Download `BlindPilot-Windows-x64.zip`.
2. Extract it anywhere and run `BlindPilot.exe` — no installation required.

**macOS**

Download `BlindPilot-macOS-arm64.zip` for Apple Silicon or `BlindPilot-macOS-x64.zip` for Intel. The macOS builds are ad-hoc signed but not notarized, so first launch may need approval in System Settings under Privacy & Security.

Settings live in `%APPDATA%\BlindPilot\config.json` on Windows and `~/.config/blindpilot/config.json` elsewhere. An existing Claude Code Reader configuration is imported once and never modified.

## Set up a backend

BlindPilot's first-run wizard and **File → Manage Backends** can find, install, update, and sign into any of the four. A missing CLI is reported as an actionable error and does not affect the others. To do it by hand:

```powershell
# Claude Code
claude --version
claude /login

# OpenAI Codex
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login

# FreeBuff
npm install -g freebuff
freebuff login

# opencode
npm install -g opencode-ai
opencode providers login
```

opencode reaches a model through a provider you connect to it, so BlindPilot carries opencode's `/connect` as a dialog of its own: type `/connect` in the prompt (or use **Connect a Provider** in the wizard) to pick from every provider opencode knows, give it an API key, or sign in through your browser. Nothing about that flow needs a terminal.

## Keyboard

- **Ctrl+L** focus the prompt, **Ctrl+T** open a session, **Ctrl+W** close it.
- **Ctrl+H** reopen a past conversation.
- **Ctrl+Shift+K** compact this conversation, **Ctrl+Shift+N** start a fresh one.
- **Ctrl+F** search responses, **Ctrl+R** jump to the latest.
- **Ctrl+/** slash commands, **Ctrl+.** stop the running task.
- **Ctrl+Shift+A** attach files, **Ctrl+Shift+M** cycle permission modes.
- **Ctrl+Shift+[** and **Ctrl+Shift+]** move between sessions; **Ctrl+1** to **Ctrl+9** jump straight to one.
- **Up** from the prompt's first line enters the newest response. At either end,
  arrow keys stay in the responses; press **Tab** to move to the prompt.

On macOS the same accelerators map to Command where appropriate.

## Run from source (any OS)

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch it: `python blind_pilot.py`

`blind_pilot.py` is the stable entry point and the implementation lives in `blindpilot_app.py`. `claude_reader.py` is a compatibility alias for anything written against the original application.

## Building

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
pyinstaller --onedir --windowed --name BlindPilot --add-data "EarCons;EarCons" blind_pilot.py
```

The one-directory layout is what lets the verified updater replace the application after it exits. The Windows installer is built from [`installer/BlindPilot.iss`](installer/BlindPilot.iss). Pushing a `v*` tag runs [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), which tests startup and the full suite, then publishes the Windows installer, the Windows x64 archive, and both macOS archives with SHA-256 files.

"""Hermes Agent backend for BlindPilot.

Hermes Agent (https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) speaks several
protocols. This adapter uses its TUI gateway JSON-RPC, which Hermes documents
as the protocol for "custom hosts that want fine-grained control of sessions,
slash commands, approvals, and streaming events" — everything a screen-reader
front end needs, and the one Hermes protocol that runs over *both* a local
pipe and a network socket.

That last property is why this adapter uses the TUI gateway rather than
Hermes' ACP mode. ACP is stdio-only, so a remote Hermes would have needed a
second, unrelated protocol and a second worker. Here one worker drives both:

    local   -- ``python -m tui_gateway.entry`` over a pipe, nothing to configure
    remote  -- the same JSON-RPC over a WebSocket to ``hermes serve``

The wire format is identical on both paths — one JSON object per line, no
Content-Length framing — because Hermes' own TUI parses stdout lines and
WebSocket frames with the same call. So :class:`HermesWorker` is written
against a transport interface and never learns which one it got.

    The point of this path is a Hermes that lives on another machine — a
    home server, or a WSL instance reached over a private network — so the
    desktop can drive it without a terminal. The protocol is the same as the
    local path; only the pipe changes.

    Authentication is a query parameter, not a header. Hermes' HTTP routes do
    accept ``X-Hermes-Session-Token``, but the WebSocket upgrade reads its
    credential from the URL and refuses the handshake without one - a header
    alone is answered with 403. Two credential names are meant for a client a
    person configures: ``token`` for the server's session token, and
    ``ticket`` for the one-shot ticket minted after a password login on a
    server reachable from outside this machine.

    The connection is read by a thread of its own, which matters for a
    connection held between turns. A Hermes bound to a public address (the
    case whenever it is reached over a private network) pings every 20 seconds
    and closes a connection that does not answer within 20 more; the client
    library only answers those pings from inside a receive call. So a
    connection nobody is reading is dropped by the server within about half a
    minute, and the reading thread is what keeps it alive while it waits.
    Frames arriving with no one waiting for them queue up rather than being
